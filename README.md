## IBackgroundJob

The `IBackgroundJob` interface defines a contract for background jobs that can be executed asynchronously. It provides a way to enqueue jobs, start the background worker thread, and stop the worker thread.

### Usage Example

```csharp
using MarketplaceEngine.Infrastructure.Background;

var job = new SearchIndexingJob();
job.ExecuteAsync().Wait();

var queue = new BackgroundJobQueue();
queue.Enqueue(job);
queue.Start();
queue.StopAsync().Wait();

Console.WriteLine($"Queue size: {queue.GetQueueSize()}");
```
